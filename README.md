# Final Project: Pipeline CPU
This folder contains all relevant code for a pipeline 32-bit MIPS Architecture CPU to be implemented with Verilog on an FPGA. The architecture consists of a Program Counter, Instruction Decoder, ALU, SRAM, Registers, and Forwarding Unit and Hazard Detection Unit.

Tree text files of CPU instructions written in machine code are included for comprehensive testing of the system.
